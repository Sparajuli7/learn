- **MetricExtractor**: Converts analysis data to comparable metrics

### API Endpoints
```
GET    /experts/list                    # List available experts
GET    /experts/{expert_id}             # Get expert details
POST   /experts/compare/{video_id}      # Compare to experts
GET    /experts/recommendations/{user_id} # Get recommendations

```

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Basic Expert Comparison
```javascript
// Compare user's video to expert patterns
const comparison = await fetch(`/api/experts/compare/${videoId}?num_experts=3`);
const { expert_comparisons } = await comparison.json();

// Get best match
const bestMatch = expert_comparisons[0];
console.log(`Best match: ${bestMatch.expert.name} (${Math.round(bestMatch.similarity_score * 100)}%)`);
```

### Get Personalized Recommendations
```javascript
// Get expert recommendations for a user
const recs = await fetch(`/api/experts/recommendations/${userId}?skill_type=Public%20Speaking`);
const { recommendations } = await recs.json();

// Display learning path
recommendations.forEach(rec => {
  console.log(`${rec.expert_name}: ${rec.learning_path.total_estimated_weeks} weeks`);
});
```
