# PROMPT 4: Real-Time Feedback and Improvement System

I need to build the real-time feedback and improvement system that provides instant suggestions.

**What I need Cursor to build:**
1. Create real-time video analysis pipeline
2. Build instant feedback generation system
3. Implement improvement suggestion engine
4. Create progress tracking and visualization
5. Build performance analytics dashboard

**Feedback types:**
- Movement analysis (posture, gestures, body language)
- Speech analysis (pace, tone, clarity, confidence)
- Performance metrics (timing, rhythm, flow)
- Expert comparison (similarity scores, improvement areas)

**New database tables:**
- FeedbackSessions (id, user_id, skill_type, feedback_data, improvement_score)
- ImprovementSuggestions (id, user_id, suggestion_type, content, priority)
- PerformanceMetrics (id, user_id, skill_type, metric_name, value, timestamp)

**Performance Target:** <30 seconds for real-time feedback

**Goal:** Provide real-time, actionable feedback that helps users improve immediately.
