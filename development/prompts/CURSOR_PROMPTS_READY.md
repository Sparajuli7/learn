# SkillMirror - Cursor Prompts Ready for Copy-Paste

This file contains all 8 prompts ready for copy-paste into Cursor. Each prompt builds on the previous one to create a comprehensive real-time learning feedback system.

## üìã Development Strategy

**Timeline**: 1 month (20-hour days if necessary)  
**Team**: 2 people (intermediate developer + agriculture major)  
**Approach**: 8 structured prompts with validation checkpoints

### Prompt Schedule:
- **Week 1**: Prompts 1-2 (Foundation + Expert Comparison)
- **Week 2**: Prompts 3-4 (Cross-Domain + Real-Time Feedback)  
- **Week 3**: Prompts 5-6 (Monetization + Mobile/API)
- **Week 4**: Prompts 7-8 (Analytics + Security/Compliance)

## üöÄ How to Use These Prompts

### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Start with Prompt 1** - Copy the entire content from `prompt-1.md`
2. **Paste into Cursor** - Let Cursor build the foundation completely
3. **Validate checkpoints** - Test each validation point thoroughly
4. **Only proceed** when previous prompt is 100% functional
5. **Move to next prompt** - Copy content from `prompt-2.md` and repeat

### **Critical Rules:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Never skip validation** - Each prompt builds on the previous
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test thoroughly** - All checkpoints must pass before moving on
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No breaking changes** - Previous functionality must remain intact
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance matters** - Maintain or improve speed with each prompt
